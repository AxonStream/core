   - Location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
   - Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue

2. **Impact Assessment**
   - How an attacker might exploit this issue
   - What type of access or capabilities an attacker could gain
   - Whether this affects multiple tenants or just single tenant

3. **Reproduction Steps**
   - Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
   - Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
   - Screenshots or videos demonstrating the issue

4. **Suggested Fix** (optional)

- **Resolution**: Target within 90 days (varies by severity)

### Severity Levels

We use the following severity classification:

#### Critical (CVSS 9.0-10.0)
- Remote code execution
- Complete system compromise
- Access to all tenant data

#### High (CVSS 7.0-8.9)
- Privilege escalation
- Cross-tenant data access

- Limited privilege escalation
- Denial of service

#### Low (CVSS 0.1-3.9)
- Minor information leaks
- Low-impact functionality issues

### Responsible Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure principles:

1. **No Public Disclosure** until the vulnerability is fixed
2. **Coordination** with the reporter on disclosure timeline
3. **Credit** given to reporters (unless they prefer to remain anonymous)
4. **Security Advisory** published after fix is deployed

### Bug Bounty Program

We currently do not have a formal bug bounty program, but we recognize and appreciate security researchers who help improve our security posture.

## Security Best Practices for Users

### For Developers Using AxonPuls

1. **API Key Security**
   ```typescript
   // ✅ Good: Use environment variables
   const client = new AxonPulsClient({
     apiKey: process.env.AXONPULS_API_KEY
   });
   
   // ❌ Bad: Hardcoded API keys
   const client = new AxonPulsClient({
     apiKey: 'axp_1234567890abcdef'
   });
   ```

2. **Input Validation**
   ```typescript
   // ✅ Good: Validate user input
   const userInput = sanitizeInput(rawInput);
   await channel.publish('message', { text: userInput });
   
   // ❌ Bad: Direct user input
   await channel.publish('message', { text: rawUserInput });
   ```

3. **Error Handling**
   ```typescript
   // ✅ Good: Don't expose sensitive information
   try {
     await client.connect();
   } catch (error) {
     logger.error('Connection failed', { userId: user.id });
     throw new Error('Connection failed');
   }
   
   // ❌ Bad: Exposing internal details
   catch (error) {
     throw error; // May contain sensitive server information
   }
   ```

### For System Administrators

1. **Network Configuration**
   - Use TLS/SSL for all connections
   - Configure firewalls to restrict access
   - Implement VPN for administrative access
   - Use private networks for internal communication

2. **Access Control**
   - Implement principle of least privilege
   - Regular access reviews and cleanup
   - Multi-factor authentication for admin accounts
   - Separate staging and production environments

3. **Monitoring**
   - Enable security monitoring and alerting
   - Regular security log reviews
   - Monitor for unusual connection patterns
   - Track failed authentication attempts

4. **Updates**
   - Keep AxonPuls Platform updated to latest version
   - Regular security patches for underlying systems
   - Monitor security advisories
   - Test updates in staging environment first
