## 🎯 MARKET LAUNCH REQUIREMENTS

### 🔧 IMMEDIATE FIXES NEEDED

**1. Monitoring Endpoints (CRITICAL)**
```bash
# Required endpoints for enterprise deployment:
GET /health          # Basic health check
GET /ready           # Kubernetes readiness
GET /live            # Kubernetes liveness  
GET /metrics         # Prometheus metrics
```

**2. Real-World Demo Environments**
- **Financial Trading**: Live demo with real market data simulation
- **Procurement**: Interactive dashboard with real vendor scenarios
- **Performance Metrics**: Response times, throughput, concurrent users
- **Visual Proof**: Screenshots, videos, live environments

**3. Enterprise Documentation**
- SLA commitments (uptime, latency)
- Security compliance (SOC2, GDPR)
- Deployment guides (Kubernetes, Docker)
- API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)
